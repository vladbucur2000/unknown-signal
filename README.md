# Unknown Signal
The goal of the project is given a set of points which follow an unknown signal, reconstruct the signal using only linear, polynomial with a fixed order or unknown nonlinear function and print the total reconstruction error.

You can find the report of the project [here](https://github.com/vladbucur2000/unknown-signal/blob/main/report.pdf).
